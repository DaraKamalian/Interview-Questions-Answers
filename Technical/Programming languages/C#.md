# C# 
## Basic
**Q: What is C#?**  
A: C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET framework. It is used to develop a wide range of applications, including desktop software, web applications, games, and mobile apps.

**Q: What are the access modifiers in C#?**  
A: Access modifiers are keywords that determine the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and other members of a program. In C#, there are four access modifiers: public, private, protected, and internal.

**Q: What is a namespace in C#?**  
A: A namespace is a way of organizing code into logical groups. It provides a way to avoid naming conflicts between classes, methods, and other elements of a program.

**Q: What is an interface in C#?**  
A: An interface in C# is a collection of abstract methods and properties that define a contract between two objects. It specifies the methods and properties that a class must implement to be considered a "contract-compliant" implementation of the interface.

**Q: What is inheritance in C#?**  
A: Inheritance is a mechanism in C# that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The class that inherits from another class is called the subclass or derived class, while the class being inherited from is called the base class or superclass.

**Q: What is polymorphism in C#?**  
A: Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same class. In C#, this is achieved through inheritance and interfaces.

**Q: What is a delegate in C#?**  
A: A delegate in C# is a type that represents a reference to a method with a specific signature. It is used to implement callbacks and event handlers, among other things.

**Q: What is LINQ in C#?**  
A: LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a feature in C# that provides a way to query data from various data sources, including databases, XML, and collections. It allows developers to write queries in a more natural, SQL-like syntax.

**Q: What is async/await in C#?**  
A: Async/await is a feature in C# that provides a way to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous-looking style. It allows developers to write code that appears to execute synchronously, but actually runs asynchronously in the background.

**Q: What is garbage collection in C#?**  
A: Garbage collection is a process in C# (and other .NET languages) that automatically frees up memory that is no longer being used by an application. It eliminates the need for manual memory management, making it easier and safer to write code.
