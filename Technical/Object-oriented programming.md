**Q: What is Object-oriented programming?**  
A: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent and manipulate data. In OOP, objects are instances of classes, which define the properties and behaviors of the objects.

**Q: What is a class?**  
A: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that an object will have, but does not actually create an object itself. Objects are created from classes using the new keyword.

**Q: What is an object?**  
A: An object is an instance of a class. It has its own set of properties and methods, and can be manipulated independently of other objects of the same class.

**Q: What is inheritance?**  
A: Inheritance is a mechanism by which a new class is derived from an existing class. The new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class, and can also add its own properties and methods.

**Q: What is encapsulation?**  
A: Encapsulation is the principle of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world. It is achieved by making certain properties and methods private, so they can only be accessed from within the object.

**Q: What is polymorphism?**  
A: Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class. It allows for the creation of code that can work with different types of objects without needing to know their specific types.

**Q: What is a constructor?**  
A: A constructor is a special method that is used to create an object from a class. It initializes the properties of the object and can take arguments to set initial values for those properties.

**Q: What is a destructor?**  
A: A destructor is a special method that is used to release resources that were acquired by an object during its lifetime. In many programming languages, including JavaScript, destructors are not used, as memory management is handled automatically by the language.

**Q: What is a method?**  
A: A method is a function that is associated with an object. It can be called on the object to perform some action or computation, and can also access the object's properties.

**Q: What is a static method?**  
A: A static method is a method that belongs to the class itself, rather than to any specific object. It can be called on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class, and is typically used for utility functions that don't require access to an object's properties.
