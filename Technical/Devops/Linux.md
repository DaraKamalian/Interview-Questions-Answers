**Q: What is a kernel module in Linux and how do you load or unload it?**
A: A kernel module in Linux is a piece of code that can be dynamically loaded into the kernel at runtime. To load a module, you can use the modprobe command, and to unload a module, you can use the rmmod command.

**Q: How do you troubleshoot a Linux system that is running slow?**
A: There are several steps you can take to troubleshoot a slow Linux system, such as checking system resource usage with commands like top and vmstat, checking system logs for errors, and analyzing network traffic with tools like tcpdump. You may also consider running performance profiling tools like perf or strace to identify performance bottlenecks.

**Q: What is SELinux and how does it improve Linux security?**
A: SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a Linux security module that provides enhanced security measures by enforcing mandatory access control policies on system resources. This allows administrators to define fine-grained access control policies for individual processes, files, and network ports, improving the security of the system.

**Q: How do you configure a Linux system to use a proxy server?**
A: To configure a Linux system to use a proxy server, you can set the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables to the proxy server URL, or you can configure the system-wide proxy settings in the /etc/environment or /etc/profile file.

**Q: How do you secure a Linux server for remote access?**
A: To secure a Linux server for remote access, you should disable root login, enforce strong password policies, use key-based authentication, and configure firewall rules to limit access to only necessary ports. You may also consider implementing additional security measures such as SELinux or a virtual private network (VPN).

**Q: What is the difference between hard and soft links in Linux?**
A: In Linux, a hard link is a reference to a file that points to the same underlying data as the original file, whereas a soft link (also known as a symbolic link) is a reference to a file that points to another file by name. Hard links can only be created for files on the same filesystem, while soft links can be created across different filesystems.

**Q: What is a Linux runlevel and how do you change it?**
A: A Linux runlevel is a state in which the system runs with a specific set of services and daemons. In most modern Linux distributions, the runlevel system has been replaced by systemd targets. To change the runlevel or systemd target, you can use the init or systemctl command, respectively.

**Q: How do you configure a Linux system to mount a remote filesystem using NFS?**
A: To configure a Linux system to mount a remote filesystem using NFS (Network File System), you must first install the nfs-utils package, then add an entry to the /etc/fstab file specifying the remote server and mount options. You can then use the mount command to mount the remote filesystem.

**Q: What is the Linux swap space and how do you configure it?**
A: The Linux swap space is a portion of disk space used to temporarily store memory pages that are not currently being used by the system. To configure swap space on a Linux system, you can create a swap partition or a swap file, then activate the swap space using the swapon command. You can also configure the system to automatically activate the swap space at boot time by adding an entry to the /etc/fstab file.
