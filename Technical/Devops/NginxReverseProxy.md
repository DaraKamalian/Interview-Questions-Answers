**Q: What is a reverse proxy in Nginx?**
A: A reverse proxy is a server that acts as an intermediary for client requests and directs those requests to one or more backend servers. In Nginx, this is achieved by using the `proxy_pass` directive to forward requests to the desired backend server.

**Q: What is the purpose of using Nginx as a reverse proxy?**
A: There are several benefits to using Nginx as a reverse proxy, including improved performance and scalability, increased security, and the ability to handle multiple domains and subdomains on a single server.

**Q: How do you configure Nginx as a reverse proxy?**
A: To configure Nginx as a reverse proxy, you need to create a new server block in your Nginx configuration file and specify the backend server using the `proxy_pass` directive. You can also configure other settings such as caching, load balancing, and SSL termination depending on your requirements.

**Q: How do you troubleshoot Nginx reverse proxy issues?**
A: Common issues with Nginx reverse proxy include misconfiguration, server errors, and network connectivity issues. To troubleshoot these issues, you can check the Nginx error log for error messages, use tools such as `curl` to test connectivity to the backend server, and run network diagnostics to ensure that all servers are reachable.

**Q: How can you improve Nginx reverse proxy performance?**
A: To improve Nginx reverse proxy performance, you can configure caching, compression, and load balancing. You can also optimize your Nginx configuration by using the `worker_processes` and `worker_connections` directives to tune the number of worker processes and connections. Additionally, you can use a content delivery network (CDN) or edge caching service to offload some of the workload.

**Q: How do you secure Nginx reverse proxy?**
A: To secure Nginx reverse proxy, you can implement SSL/TLS encryption using a valid SSL certificate, restrict access to the proxy using IP whitelisting or authentication, and configure rate limiting to prevent DDoS attacks. You can also regularly update Nginx and its dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

**Q: What is the difference between Nginx proxy and reverse proxy?**
A: An Nginx proxy is a server that acts as a mediator between the client and the original server. In contrast, an Nginx reverse proxy is a server that sits between the client and multiple backend servers, forwarding requests from the client to the appropriate backend server.

**Q: How do you configure Nginx to handle SSL traffic?**
A: To configure Nginx to handle SSL traffic, you need to create a server block with the SSL configuration parameters and enable the SSL module. You also need to create a certificate and private key file, and configure the server block to use them.

**Q: How can you prevent the slowloris attack on an Nginx server?**
A: To prevent the slowloris attack on an Nginx server, you can set the `client_body_timeout` and `client_header_timeout` directives to a lower value, limit the maximum number of connections per IP address using the `limit_conn_zone` directive, and enable the `limit_req_zone` directive to limit the number of requests per IP address.

**Q: What is the purpose of the `proxy_cache` directive in Nginx?**
A: The `proxy_cache` directive in Nginx is used to cache responses from backend servers, which can improve the performance of the server by reducing the number of requests to the backend servers. The cached responses are stored in the disk, and can be served to clients without having to contact the backend servers.

**Q: How can you configure Nginx to serve static files?**
A: To configure Nginx to serve static files, you need to create a server block with the appropriate `root` directive that points to the directory where the files are located. You also need to add the appropriate MIME types to the `types` directive to ensure that the files are served with the correct content type. Additionally, you can configure caching for the static files using the `expires` and `add_header` directives.
