# Testing and debugging
**Q: What is testing in software development?**  
A: Testing is the process of evaluating a software product or system to detect defects or errors and to ensure that it meets its requirements and user expectations.

**Q: What is debugging in software development?**  
A: Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing defects or errors in software code.

**Q: What are some common testing techniques?**  
A: Some common testing techniques include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and regression testing.

**Q: What is the purpose of unit testing?**  
A: The purpose of unit testing is to test individual units or components of code to ensure that they function correctly and meet their requirements.

**Q: What is the difference between black box and white box testing?**  
A: Black box testing is a testing technique where the tester does not have access to the internal workings of the software being tested. White box testing, on the other hand, is a testing technique where the tester has access to the internal workings of the software being tested.

**Q: What is a test plan?**  
A: A test plan is a document that outlines the testing approach, objectives, scope, and resources required for a specific software testing project.

**Q: What is a defect report?**  
A: A defect report is a document that identifies a defect or error in the software being tested, including information on how to reproduce the issue and its impact on the system.

**Q: What is a regression test?**  
A: A regression test is a type of software testing that ensures that changes to the software do not introduce new defects or errors.

**Q: What is a breakpoint?**  
A: A breakpoint is a tool used in debugging that pauses the execution of a program at a specific point to allow the programmer to inspect the program's state and variables.

**Q: What is the difference between static and dynamic testing?**  
A: Static testing is a testing technique that examines the software code without executing it, while dynamic testing involves executing the software and observing its behavior.
