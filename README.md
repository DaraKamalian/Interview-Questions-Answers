Q: What is JavaScript?
A: JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is used to create dynamic web pages and web applications. It is a client-side scripting language that runs in the browser and is used to add interactivity to web pages.

Q: What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?
A: The double equals (==) operator checks for equality only in terms of value, while the triple equals (===) operator checks for equality in terms of value and data type. For example, 5 == "5" would return true, while 5 === "5" would return false because they are of different data types.

Q: What are the data types in JavaScript?
A: JavaScript has six primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol. In addition, it also has one non-primitive data type: object.

Q: What is hoisting in JavaScript?
A: Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes before the code is executed. This means that you can use a variable or function before it has been declared. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the assignment or initialization.

Q: What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?
A: var, let, and const are used to declare variables in JavaScript. The main difference between them is in their scope and how they can be reassigned. var has a function scope and can be reassigned. let and const have a block scope and cannot be redeclared, but let can be reassigned while const cannot.

Q: What is closure in JavaScript?
A: A closure is a feature in JavaScript that allows a function to access and remember the variables and functions that are present in its lexical scope even after the outer function has returned. This allows for a function to have private variables and functions that cannot be accessed from outside the function.

Q: What are the different types of errors in JavaScript?
A: There are three types of errors in JavaScript: syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors. Syntax errors occur when the code is not written correctly and cannot be parsed by the browser. Runtime errors occur when the code is executing and encounters a problem, such as trying to access a variable that does not exist. Logical errors occur when the code runs without error, but produces the wrong output.

What is the difference between let and var in JavaScript?
Answer: The main difference between let and var in JavaScript is their scope. Variables declared with var have function scope or global scope, while variables declared with let have block scope. Additionally, variables declared with var can be redeclared within the same scope, while variables declared with let cannot.

What is event bubbling in JavaScript?
Answer: Event bubbling is the process in which an event first triggers on the most specific target element, and then "bubbles up" to the containing elements in the DOM hierarchy until it reaches the document object. This means that if you have nested elements that each have an event listener for the same event, the innermost element's event will trigger first, followed by the outer elements.

What is the purpose of the "use strict" directive in JavaScript?
Answer: The "use strict" directive is a way to enable strict mode in JavaScript. Strict mode is a way to opt into a restricted version of JavaScript that disallows certain syntax that is prone to errors or considered bad practice. It also enables more thorough error checking and makes the code more secure.

What is the difference between a method and a function in JavaScript?
Answer: A method is a function that is associated with an object and can be called on that object using dot notation. A function, on the other hand, is a standalone block of code that can be called with or without an object reference.

What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in JavaScript?
Answer: Synchronous programming is when each task is executed one after the other in a single thread, while asynchronous programming is when tasks are executed concurrently in separate threads, allowing other tasks to run while waiting for a slow operation to complete.

What are the different types of loops in JavaScript?
Answer: There are three types of loops in JavaScript: for, while, and do-while loops. The for loop is used to iterate a specific number of times, the while loop is used to iterate while a condition is true, and the do-while loop is similar to the while loop but guarantees that the loop body will be executed at least once.

How do you convert a string to a number in JavaScript?
Answer: You can convert a string to a number in JavaScript using the Number() or parseInt() function. The Number() function converts a string to a number, while parseInt() function converts a string to an integer.

What is the difference between slice() and splice() methods in JavaScript?
Answer: The slice() method is used to return a copy of a portion of an array, while the splice() method is used to add or remove elements from an array at a specific index.

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
Answer: Null and undefined are both used to represent absence of value, but they have different meanings. Null represents a deliberate non-value, while undefined represents an unintentional absence of value.

What is the difference between call() and apply() methods in JavaScript?
Answer: The call() and apply() methods are both used to invoke a function with a specific object as the value of "this", but they differ in how arguments are passed to the function. The call() method passes arguments as a comma-separated list, while the apply() method passes arguments as an array.
