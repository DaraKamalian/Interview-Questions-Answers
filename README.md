Q: What is JavaScript?

Q: What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?
A: The double equals (==) operator checks for equality only in terms of value, while the triple equals (===) operator checks for equality in terms of value and data type. For example, 5 == "5" would return true, while 5 === "5" would return false because they are of different data types.

Q: What are the data types in JavaScript?
A: JavaScript has six primitive data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol. In addition, it also has one non-primitive data type: object.

Q: What is hoisting in JavaScript?
A: Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes before the code is executed. This means that you can use a variable or function before it has been declared. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the assignment or initialization.

Q: What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?
A: var, let, and const are used to declare variables in JavaScript. The main difference between them is in their scope and how they can be reassigned. var has a function scope and can be reassigned. let and const have a block scope and cannot be redeclared, but let can be reassigned while const cannot.

Q: What is closure in JavaScript?
A: A closure is a feature in JavaScript that allows a function to access and remember the variables and functions that are present in its lexical scope even after the outer function has returned. This allows for a function to have private variables and functions that cannot be accessed from outside the function.

Q: What are the different types of errors in JavaScript?
A: There are three types of errors in JavaScript: syntax errors, runtime errors, and logical errors. Syntax errors occur when the code is not written correctly and cannot be parsed by the browser. Runtime errors occur when the code is executing and encounters a problem, such as trying to access a variable that does not exist. Logical errors occur when the code runs without error, but produces the wrong output.
